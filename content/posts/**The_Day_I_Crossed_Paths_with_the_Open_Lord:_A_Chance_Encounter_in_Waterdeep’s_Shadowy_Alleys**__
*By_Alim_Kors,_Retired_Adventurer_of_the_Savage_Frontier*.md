The City of Splendors, Waterdeep, is a roiling tapestry of noise, light, and intrigue. Even a seasoned traveler like me—a man who once tracked goblin warbands through the High Forest and haggled with tiefling spice-merchants in Calimshan—can feel overwhelmed by its grandeur. But I wasn’t there for spectacle that day, ten summers past. I was there for three mundane tasks: purchasing steel nails for a shed, commissioning a lute-string from a gnome luthier in Trades Ward, and eating the finest buttered crab in Faerûn at the Chespered Sail. Fate, however, delights in disrupting errands.

The afternoon sun slanted across the crowded stalls of the Market Square, painting rainbows in the spray of a street-performer’s enchanted fountains. I was examining a bolt of emerald silk (a *whim*, mind you—my adventuring days of courting nobles with trinkets were long behind me) when I noticed the boy. Gaunt, maybe twelve winters old, darting through the crowd with a practiced ease that set my instincts humming. His eyes lingered too long on a merchant’s coin-purse, his fingers twitching with nervous hunger. Retired or not, old habits bleed into the bones. I shifted, turning sideways to watch without staring.  

Beside the silk vendor stood an elven woman wrapped in a hooded cloak of unremarkable gray wool. She moved with the unconscious grace of her kind—like wind through willow branches—but something struck me as peculiar. Most high elves in Waterdeep wear their lineage like jewelry: velvets, brooches, perhaps a whisper of arcane potency. This woman was subdued, almost intentionally forgettable. Yet her eyes… They held a weight, a depth, like moonlight on still water.  

The boy struck as she turned to examine a silver bracelet. Quick as a viper, his hand slipped into the folds of her cloak. My body moved before my mind caught up. I seized his wrist—gently, no need to break bones over a loaf of bread—and pulled him back.  

“Not today, lad,” I murmured, keeping my voice low.  

Chaos erupted. The boy yowled, not in fear, but in theatrical outrage. “Thief! He’s robbing me!”  

Ah, the oldest trick in Luskan’s gutters. The crowd surged, merchants reaching for cudgels, guardsmen turning. The elven woman spun, her hood falling back in the motion, and I froze.  

Silver hair streamed like liquid starlight. Eyes the color of storm clouds met mine, sharp and assessing. I knew that face from tapestries in lords’ halls, from ballads sung in taverns when politics turned lively. *Laeral Silverhand*. Open Lord of Waterdeep, Archmage of the City, and one of the legendary Seven Sisters.  

In that heartbeat, two truths collided: I was grappling a would-be pickpocket in front of the most powerful person in the North, and the boy had accomplices. Three burly dockworkers—paid muscle, by the look of their rusty blades—lunged from the crowd.  

“I’m unarmed!” I barked (a lie; my dagger was strapped to my calf, but diplomacy first). The nearest thug swung a fist. I ducked, shoving the boy toward an apple cart. Fruit scattered, the vendor shrieking curses in Illuskan. A blade nicked my elbow—just a scratch, but blood welled hot and red.  

Then, light bloomed.  

Not the crackling fury of battle magic, but soft, silver radiance that rolled like mist from Laeral’s outstretched hand. It washed over the square, gentle as a sigh. The thugs staggered, blinking as if waking from sleep. The boy went limp, snoring in a pile of bruised apples.  

Silence fell, broken only by the indignant clucking of a displaced chicken.  

Laeral stepped forward. No rage, no theatrics. Her voice, when it came, was clear and resonant, yet somehow intimate—a mountain spring heard from a foot away. “The Watch is coming. Flee now, or face the Blackstaff’s judgment.”  

The thugs needed no second warning. They vanished into the warren of alleys faster than rats down a drain. The boy, still blessedly unconscious, was hoisted by a guard captain who arrived moments later.  

She turned to me then, appraising. I wiped blood from my elbow onto my tunic—a shabby thing, threadbare at the hem—and offered a half-bow. “Apologies for the mess, my lady. Didn’t mean to spoil your afternoon shopping.”  

A flicker of amusement crossed her face. “You intervened when most would’ve looked away. That deserves thanks, not apology.” She gestured to my arm. “May I?”  

Before I could protest, her fingertips grazed the cut. Warmth flooded my skin, the flesh knitting with a faint golden glow. Greater Restoration, deployed for a scratch. Extravagant, yet somehow… kind.  

“You’re Alim Kors,” she said abruptly.  

I blinked. “Retired, these past five years. Guild work in Silverymoon now, mostly.”  

“I’ve read your report on the orc clans near Everlund. The Lord’s Alliance found it… instructive.”  

I coughed, surprised. That dusty scroll, penned after a particularly miserable month scouting the High Moor? The praise warmed me more than the healing spell.  

We spoke briefly—less than ten breaths. She asked after mutual acquaintances in Harpell Tower, lamented the rising price of dwarf-forged hinges (“Even Waterdeep’s vaults aren’t bottomless”), and nodded when I mentioned counseling Silverymoon’s Gemcutters’ Guild.  

“Guilds are the lifeblood of cities,” she mused. “But like blood, they must flow *with* the body, not against it.” A warning? Advice? Even now, I’m not sure.  

As abruptly as it began, the conversation ended. The silver hair vanished beneath her hood. “A pleasant day to you, Master Kors.”  

Then she was gone, melting into the crowd as though she’d never been there. A merchant scooped apples, grumbling. The tang of cider-sour fruit hung in the air.  

I walked back to my inn that evening, elbow healed, lute-string forgotten in my pocket. The encounter lingered, not for the brush with fame—gods know I’ve supped with dukes and dueled necromancers—but for its *ordinariness*. Laeral Silverhand, a myth in mortal flesh, had healed a stranger’s cut over split apples and gutter-thieves.  

That’s Waterdeep, I suppose. A city where legends buy bread. Where a retired sellsword can cross paths with a Queen of the North, not on a battlefield, but in a squabble over silk and silver.  

I never told this story in the guildhalls. It felt… private. A moment of unpolished humanity between two people whose lives had been forged in fire and duty. But I’ve come to see its lesson: greatness isn’t always in the grand gestures. Sometimes, it’s in the quiet acts—a mended wound, an apple vendor compensated with anonymous gold slipped into their till, a boy given over to the Watch instead of the streets.  

Would I intervene again? Absolutely—though I’d likely dodge left instead of right to avoid the blade. Some habits, like hope in the Shadowfell, die hard. But then, so do some mercies.
