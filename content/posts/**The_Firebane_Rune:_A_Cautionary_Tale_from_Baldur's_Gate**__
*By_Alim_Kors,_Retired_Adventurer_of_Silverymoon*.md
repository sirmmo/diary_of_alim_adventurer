### Prologue: The Call That Broke the Peace  
Retirement, I’d come to learn, was less a surrender of adrenaline than a transformation of its source. In Silverymoon, I traded dungeon crawls for council meetings and necromantic threats for zoning disputes—until the day a blood-stained letter arrived. It bore the seal of the Order of the Gauntlet and smelled of sea salt and urgency. Within was a request from an old ally: *"The Firebane Rune has resurfaced. It’s in Baldur’s Gate. And he’s after it."* 

The "he" was Vorlund Stonehand. Once a revered companion, now a snarling ghost from my past. We’d fought side-by-side in the Troll Wars of the North, but that was before bitterness hollowed him out. The Rune? A relic of such volatile power that it had torn apart the guild that first unearthed it. That guild was now defunct, its members scattered or dead—save Vorlund and me. 

Five years of peace evaporated with that letter. I strapped on my weathered leathers, kissed my wife goodbye, and rode south toward the Gate. Some debts refuse burial.

### Chapter 1: Shadows Over the Outer City  
Baldur’s Gate in the height of summer is a symphony of sweat and vice. The Outer City’s maze of leaning tenements and clattering docks swallowed me whole. My contact, a dwarven smith named **Heldra Foespike**, met me at the Blushing Mermaid. Over tankards of warm ale, she revealed the Rune’s trail. 

"Stonehand’s been lurkin’ like a ghoul near the Undercellar," she rasped, her eyes darting. "Bought enough blackpowder to flatten a keep. Says he’s ‘restorin’ justice.’" 

Justice. An ugly word in the mouth of a man betrayed. Vorlund blamed the Order for disbanding our guild after the Rune’s corruption killed three members. He’d called it a coward’s move, spat in my face when I voted for dissolution. "You’d throw away our legacy over a few stains?" he’d snarled. 

Now, he meant to wield the Rune’s power openly—to "cleanse" Baldur’s Gate’s corrupt elite, starting with the patriars who’d funded our ill-fated expedition. A city-wide pyre cloaked in idealism.  

The Rune itself? A fist-sized shard of amber, etched with primordial glyphs. Touch it to flame, and it drinks the heat, growing colder until it erupts in a blast of controlled inferno. Useful for clearing ice-locked ruins; catastrophic in a city built of timber and ambition.

### Chapter 2: The Locksmith’s Gamble  
The Rune hadn’t been seen since we’d sealed it in a lead-lined vault beneath Candulhallow’s Tombstones. But tombs, like promises, can crack. Heldra traced its reappearance to a locksmith named **Talis**, who’d bragged about bypassing the tomb’s wards. Talis, however, now swung from the rafters of his own shop in the Lower City. Vorlund’s handiwork: a garrote of piano wire and a note pinned to Talis’s chest—*"Greed dissolves faster than blood."* 

The locksmith’s ledger pointed me to the *Riverveins*, the sewer tunnels beneath the Upper City. Vorlund had paid Talis to retrieve the Rune, then killed him to erase the trail. But Talis, ever the schemer, had hidden the Rune elsewhere—staking it as collateral in a *dragonchess* game at the infamous **Copper Cup**.  

Here, the tale twists into farce. The Rune sat in a moth-eaten velvet pouch behind the Cup’s bar, held by a gnome bookie named **Pikkle "Two-Tongues"** as surety for Talis’s 50-gold debt. "Not my problem if it glows!" Pikkle shrugged when I confronted him. Vorlund, it seemed, hadn’t known about his pawn’s gambling vice. 

I bargained. Pikkle demanded 100 gold—"interest, plus existential risk fee." We settled at 75, plus my signing his prized dragonchessboard. The Rune pulsed faintly in my hand like a sleeping serpent.  

### Chapter 3: The Burning Docks  
Victory lasted eight minutes.  

As I crept through the fog-cloaked docks toward the Order’s safehouse, arrows sprouted from crates around me. Six of Vorlund’s hired knives—Flaming Fist deserters by their scarred armor—lurched from the shadows. Vorlund himself watched from a nearby warehouse, face lit by the phosphorus glare of alchemist’s fire.  

"Still carrying everyone’s burdens, Alim?" he roared. "That Rune belongs to those *willing* to use it!"  

What followed was less a duel than a demolition. The Rune, jostled in my pack, reacted to nearby torchlight. Frost crackled across my back; a keg of lamp oil flash-froze and shattered. Vorlund’s thugs slipped on sudden ice. I lunged for the warehouse ladder—  

—just as Vorlund flung a vial of flame.  

The blast shredded the dock. Wood splinters rained like javelins. I rolled behind a cart as Vorlund snatched the Rune’s pouch from my torn pack. His laughter was a blade. "You see? It *chooses* resolve!"  

### Chapter 4: The Bridge of Regrets  
He fled to Wyrm’s Crossing, aiming for the Outer City slums where his "cleansing" would begin. I pursued, bloodied but buoyed by fury. At the bridge’s apex, Vorlund wheeled to face me, the Rune glowing like a tiny sun as dusk fell.  

"Remember the Icehall Pass?" he hissed. "We saved a village with this! Now I’ll save a *city*."  

"By melting it?" I edged closer. The Rune’s heat-drinking effect intensified; my breath fogged in the summer air. "The patriars’ll hide in their marble towers. You’ll only burn the people you swore to protect!"  

His face twisted. "Sacrifices—"  

"—are made *by* the powerful, *for* the weak. Not the other way around."  

A flicker of doubt. The Rune, sensing his wavering will, flared violently. Vorlund screamed as frost encased his arm. The relic was eating *him* now, too starved to distinguish ally from fuel.  

I did then what swords and spells couldn’t. I spoke his son’s name.  

**"Jerrol."**  

Vorlund froze. The boy had died in a plague years prior, unmentioned since. "He’d be twelve now," I pressed. "Would he call this justice—or madness?"  

The Rune shrieked. Amber fissures spiderwebbed its surface. Vorlund wept as hoarfrost climbed his neck. With a final roar, he hurled it toward the Chionthar River.  

The detonation lit the sky. A pillar of steam erupted where the Rune hit water, scalding fish and rattling bridge stones. When the mist cleared, Vorlund was gone—leaving only melted bootprints and a snarl of wet rope.  

He’d jumped. A sailor’s skiff later reported pulling a one-armed man from the river, raving about "fire in the deep." I never confirmed it was him. Some ghosts are best left drifting.

### Epilogue: The Weight of Quiet  
The Order paid Pikkle’s "risk fee" and bricked up Candulhallow’s Tomb anew. I returned to Silverymoon, where guild politics suddenly felt less petty. Power, I’d learned, isn’t measured by what you can seize, but what you can *release*.  

Old adventurers love to say, "I’d do it all again." I wouldn’t. Not the blood, not the loss—but perhaps the lesson.  

Vorlund wasn’t evil. He was a man who let grief ferment into poison. The Rune? Just a tool. Like a council vote. Like a kind word. Like forgiveness.  

And tools, wielded without wisdom, become weapons—against others, and ourselves.
