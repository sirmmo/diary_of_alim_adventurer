Let me preface this by saying two things: First, seduction was never my preferred blade. Give me a straightforward brawl over the subtle dance of courtship any day. Second, cats—especially the clever ones in Waterdeep—are agents of chaos wrapped in velvet fur. Combine these truths, and you have the tale of how I very nearly set fire to a noble’s pride, a rival’s ego, and my own reputation, all thanks to a green-eyed feline named Mistletoe.  

It was the Year of the Purple Dragons, during Waterdeep’s midwinter Masquerade of Silver Threads—an event where nobles play at being mysterious and adventurers play at being nobles. I’d been hired as discreet security for House Adarbrent (a story for another time), but my attention drifted to Lady Eliana Dyre, a sharp-tongued half-elf historian with a laugh like wind chimes and a withering glare for anyone who mentioned her family’s *minor* scandal involving mimic-forged silverware.  

Our first conversation was accidental. She’d cornered me near a champagne fountain, mistaking me for a waiter. When I handed her a glass with a flourished bow anyway, she arched an eyebrow. “You handle crystal like a man who’s stolen his share of it.” I replied, “Only from those who deserved redundancy audits,” and her startled laughter drew eyes. So far, so good.  

Here’s where the cat arrives—literally.  

As I escorted Eliana to the balcony, a small tortoiseshell cat darted between our feet, nearly tripping us both. It belonged to nobody. Or rather, it belonged to *every* reveler who’d slipped it shrimp skewers all evening. Waterdeep’s street cats are opportunists, but this one? A maestro. It wound around Eliana’s ankles, purring like a soprano, green eyes fixed on me as if critiquing my performance.  

“You’ve an admirer,” Eliana teased, scooping the creature up. It nestled into her arms, its gaze never leaving mine. I swear it winked.  

Now, I’d planned a charming line about the stars over the Sea Ward. Instead, I blurted, “It clearly recognizes quality. Unlike the gentleman by the harp staring daggers at us.” The dagger-starrer? Lord Torvus Flinthelm, Eliana’s former suitor, a man whose ego was matched only by his inability to grow a proper beard.  

Eliana’s smile turned feline. “Torvus believes ownership is nine-tenths of courtship. He’ll stew until he explodes.”  

The cat—Mistletoe, as a passing servant named her—leaped from Eliana’s arms onto my shoulder, paws kneading my best doublet. One claw snagged the lace. Eliana laughed again, reaching to disentangle her. Our fingers brushed. Progress, I thought.  

Then Mistletoe took matters into her own paws.  

As Torvus stormed toward us, the cat launched herself at his head.  

Chaos ensued. Torvus yelped, swatting at a blur of fur and claws. Mistletoe vaulted onto a dessert tray, sending cakes flying like siege ammunition. A startled bard plucked a discordant note. And Eliana? She laughed so hard she gripped my arm for balance, tears glinting behind her mask.  

In the aftermath, Torvus fled, icing sugar dusting his hair like ill-gotten snow. Mistletoe reappeared on my boots, licking her paw with serene dignity. Eliana wiped her eyes. “Well. That’s one way to end an argument.”  

Here’s where a wiser man would’ve retired the scene. But the champagne, the adrenaline, and those damned green eyes (Eliana’s, not the cat’s) had me reckless. I kissed her—briefly, **just** as the clocks struck midnight.  

She pulled back, amused. “You realize that cat belongs to Zardra Zord, don’t you?”  

Zardra Zord. Merchant tycoon. Torvus’s business rival. And, as it happened, the cat’s *actual* owner—a fact Mistletoe had obscured by treating half the neighborhood as her staff.  

*Ah.*  

Zardra materialized moments later, having watched the entire debacle from the shadows. Her smirk could’ve cut glass. “I see Mistletoe’s improved your evening, Kors. She’s an excellent judge of character. And terrible judges of it.” Her gaze flicked toward Torvus’s retreating form.  

Eliana grinned. “She certainly… *redirects* tensions.”  

The rest of the night involved shared wine, Zardra’s dry commentary, and Mistletoe stealing my smoked salmon tartlet. By dawn, Torvus’s embarrassment was the talk of the Sea Ward, Eliana agreed to let me take her to the opera, and Zardra gifted me a sardonic toast: “To unexpected allies. And their furry strategists.”  

But the lesson? In Waterdeep, even love—or its facsimile—is a team sport. You might think you’re the hero of your own tale, only to find a cat, a rival, or a pastry ambush stealing the scene.  

Eliana and I dined together thrice more before her work took her to Candlekeep. Mistletoe attended two of those dinners, napping on my cloak in silent approval. When Eliana left, she gave me a lingering kiss and whispered, “Next time, skip the masquerade. And bring your own cat.”  

As for Torvus? He commissioned a dreadful ballad about “the knave, the lady, and the fiend in fur.” I’ve heard it’s popular in taverns… provided patrons are drunk enough.  

In my quieter moments here in Silverymoon, watching guildmasters scheme over tea, I think of Mistletoe. She’s likely ruling a merchant’s warehouse somewhere, her chaos now someone else’s courtship crisis. And Eliana? She sends letters. Sometimes, they include cat hairs.  

So yes—seduction isn’t my forte. But in Waterdeep, you never know what whiskered wildcard might rewrite your evening… if you let it.
