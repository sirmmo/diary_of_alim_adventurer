The smell of brine and sewage still haunts me when I think of Baldur’s Gate. Not the glittering Upper City, mind you—those manicured gardens and marble towers were never my stage. No, it was the grime-choked alleyways of the Lower City, the whispered deals in the Slug & Serpent, and the forgotten crypts beneath Candlekeep’s shadow that shaped my most unforgettable misadventures. One, in particular, stands out: the day we unleashed arcane chaos upon a troll warband using artifacts far older and stranger than we understood. It’s a tale of hubris, unintended consequences, and the kind of raw, messy magic that makes modern wizards clutch their spellbooks in horror.  

### The Relics Beneath the Ruins  
It began, as such stories often do, with a rumor. A merchant’s daughter claimed her father’s caravan had been ambushed near the Coast Way, not by bandits, but by trolls wielding crude, pulsating devices that emitted waves of oppressive heat. Trolls are rarely innovators—they’re scavengers, blunt and brutal—so the idea of them brandishing artifacts piqued our crew’s curiosity. My companions at the time included Ellara, a half-elf diviner with a knack for explosive solutions; Durak, a shield dwarf cleric of Moradin who prayed as loudly as he fought; and Finn, a halfling rogue whose sticky fingers were matched only by his sharp tongue.  

We traced the trolls’ trail to a collapsed Netherese outpost buried beneath the cliffs south of Candlekeep. Scholars had dismissed the site as picked clean centuries ago, but they’d overlooked a sealed chamber shielded by fading *wards of obfuscation*. Inside, we found six gauntlets forged of a dull, blue-black metal, humming with latent energy. They bore runes none of us recognized—not even Ellara, who’d deciphered Yuan-ti hieroglyphs blindfolded once on a dare.  

### The Trap of Curiosity  
The gauntlets were cold to the touch, yet they seemed to *pull* at the wearer’s magic. Durak’s holy senses detected no outright malice in them, only a "hunger" (his exact words). Against his mumbled objections, we took them to a contact in Baldur’s Gate: an eccentric gnomish tinkerer named Piklok Sparksprocket. His workshop, buried in the Lower City’s labyrinthine docks, smelled of ozone and overcooked turnips.  

Piklok’s initial tests were… illuminating. The gauntlets absorbed spells channeled into them, amplifying their effects but warping their nature. A simple *fire bolt* became a cascading inferno that scorched Piklok’s eyebrows off. A *ray of frost* birthed a localized blizzard that took three hours to melt. Their most unsettling trait, though, was their autonomy. Once attuned, they’d lash out at nearby threats without the wearer’s command, as if driven by ancient, half-sentient fury.  

"We’re calling them the Gauntlets of Unshackled Fury," Piklok declared, grinning through his singed beard. "Netherese leftovers, maybe? Or something older? Either way, they’re *magnificently* unstable!"  

We should have left them in the ruins.  

### Trolls, Fire, and Unplanned Urban Renewal  
Two nights later, trolls attacked the Outer City. Not the usual scattered raiders—this was a coordinated assault. Thirty-strong, they surged from the sewers near the Basilisk Gate, smashing through merchant stalls and tenements. Worse, they carried devices akin to those described by the merchant’s daughter: jagged iron spheres that emitted blistering waves of heat. Buildings caught fire from *proximity* alone. The Flaming Fist was overwhelmed.  

We donned the gauntlets in desperation.  

What followed was less a battle and more a catastrophic dialogue between two forces of raw destruction. Durak’s gauntlet amplified his *searing smite* into a column of divine fire that incinerated three trolls in seconds—and obliterated the facade of the Seven Suns Trading Coster. Finn learned the hard way that the gauntlets interpreted "stealth" as "unleashing sonic screeches with every step." My own attempt to cast a *wall of force* birthed a shimmering, gelatinous barrier that engulfed a troll mid-charge and dissolved it into sludge.  

The gauntlets worked, yes—but they were feral. Uncontrollable. Ours weren’t the only casualties. A misfired pulse from Ellara’s glove collapsed the roof of the Helm and Cloak Inn (thankfully evacuated, though the proprietor still sends me angry letters). The trolls’ devices reacted violently to the gauntlets’ magic, detonating in chain reactions that left craters smoking with acid and singed troll flesh.  

### The Cost of Victory  
By dawn, the trolls were reduced to charred bones and puddles of steaming regeneration-slurry. Baldur’s Gate’s Lower City, however, resembled a dragon’s chew toy. Thirty-seven buildings damaged, twelve flattened entirely. The Gauntlets of Unshackled Fury had gone dormant after the battle, their metal now brittle and cold. Piklok later theorized they’d been designed as siege weapons—meant to raze fortifications, not defend them. We’d turned them against their purpose, and the city paid the price.  

In the aftermath, as we helped dig survivors from rubble, a Flaming Fist captain spat at my feet. "Adventurers," he snarled. "Always so eager to play with fire until the world burns."  

He wasn’t wrong.  

### Lessons Etched in Ash  
I keep one of the shattered gauntlets on my mantle here in Silverymoon. A reminder. Magic is not a toy, nor is it merely a tool—it is a conversation with forces older than nations, wilder than wyrms. The Netherese understood that; they built wonders and died in the echo of their arrogance. We wield their relics like children swinging swords in the dark.  

The trolls, I later learned, had been driven from their swamp by a dragon cult. The heat-spheres they carried were intended to melt ice obstructing a buried temple. In their desperation, they’d turned to artifacts they didn’t comprehend, just as we had. There’s poetry in that, I suppose. Or tragedy.  

These days, I advise the Arcane Guild of Silverymoon on artifact containment protocols. Durak runs an orphanage (and preaches temperance in all things). Ellara hunts illithids in the Underdark, no doubt laughing as she blows things up "safely." Finn? Last I heard, he’s a cheesemaker in Amphail. Some wounds heal better far from the front lines.  

The Gauntlets of Unshackled Fury taught me that power untempered by wisdom is a threat to everyone—especially the fool wielding it. Baldur’Gate rebuilt, as cities do, but the scars remain. So do the ghosts of choices made in haste.  

Retirement suits me. But on quiet nights, when the moon washes over the Evermoors, I still feel the cold weight of those gauntlets. Still hear the screams. Still taste the ash.
