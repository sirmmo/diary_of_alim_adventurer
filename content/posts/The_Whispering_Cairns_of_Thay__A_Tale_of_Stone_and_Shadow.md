The dust of Thay still clings to my boots, though it’s been nigh on a decade since I last set foot in that sun-baked, unforgiving land.  I’ve seen wonders and horrors in my years – the shimmering forests of Chult, the haunted ruins of Netheril, the icy peaks of Icewind Dale – but nothing quite prepared me for what I witnessed in the heart of the Serpent Spine mountains.  It wasn’t a grand battle, nor a cunning political maneuver. It was… something else entirely. Something that stirred the very earth and whispered of forgotten powers.

I was traveling with a small band then.  A human cleric of Pelor named Elara, a half-elf ranger named Faelan, and a rather eccentric gnome artificer named Fizzwick. We were ostensibly on a diplomatic mission – a rather delicate one, involving trade agreements with a remote Thayan village nestled amongst the peaks.  The Thayan were… reserved.  Their culture is steeped in ritual and tradition, and they rarely welcomed outsiders with open arms.  But the village elder, a woman named Lyra, had been insistent. She spoke of a growing unease, of unsettling dreams and strange occurrences plaguing their community.  She believed, with a conviction that bordered on desperation, that we could help.

The journey itself was arduous. The Serpent Spine is aptly named. Jagged peaks claw at the sky, and the paths are treacherous, winding through narrow canyons and across crumbling bridges. The Thayan landscape is stark, beautiful in its harshness, and utterly devoid of the lush vegetation one might expect.  The air is dry and thin, and the sun beats down with relentless intensity.  Faelan, ever the pragmatist, grumbled constantly about the lack of decent hunting grounds. Fizzwick, however, was in his element, muttering about geological formations and the potential for harnessing geothermal energy. Elara, bless her heart, simply prayed for our safe passage.

We spent several days in the village, listening to Lyra and the other Thayan recount their troubles.  The unsettling dreams were common – visions of colossal, shadowy figures moving beneath the earth, accompanied by a low, guttural chanting.  The strange occurrences were more tangible: livestock disappearing without a trace, unsettling tremors that shook the ground, and a pervasive feeling of being watched.  They spoke of ancient cairns, stone mounds scattered across the mountainside, that had always been considered sacred.  But lately, these cairns had begun to… *hum*.  A low, resonant vibration that could be felt more than heard.

Lyra believed the disturbances were connected to the cairns, that something – or someone – was awakening within them.  She feared a resurgence of old, forgotten powers, something that had been deliberately buried and sealed away centuries ago.  I confess, I initially dismissed her concerns as superstition.  But the palpable fear in the Thayan’s eyes, the unsettling atmosphere of the village, and the increasingly frequent tremors began to erode my skepticism.

We decided to investigate the cairns.  Lyra led us to the largest of them, a massive mound of weathered stone perched on a windswept plateau.  It was easily fifty feet high, and covered in intricate carvings – grotesque faces, serpentine figures, and symbols that were utterly alien to me.  The air around the cairn thrummed with a palpable energy, a low, almost subsonic vibration that resonated deep within my bones.

As we approached, the chanting began.  It was faint at first, a low, rhythmic drone that seemed to emanate from the earth itself.  But it grew steadily louder, building into a chorus of guttural voices that sent shivers down my spine.  The ground beneath our feet trembled violently, and dust and pebbles rained down from the cairn’s summit.

Then, the stone began to *move*.

Not in a dramatic, earth-shattering way.  But subtly, almost imperceptibly.  The stones shifted, rearranged themselves, as if guided by an unseen force.  The carvings seemed to writhe and twist, the grotesque faces contorting into expressions of rage and malice.  The chanting intensified, and the air grew thick with a cloying, sulfurous smell.

And then, from the heart of the cairn, *they* emerged.

Trolls.  But not the brutish, mindless trolls one might encounter in a goblin cave.  These were… different.  They were taller, leaner, and possessed a disturbing intelligence in their eyes.  Their skin was not the usual mottled green, but a deep, obsidian black, and their bodies were covered in intricate, glowing runes.  They moved with a fluid grace that belied their size, and their eyes burned with an unholy light.

They weren’t attacking.  They weren’t roaring or bellowing.  They were… *conducting*.  

The trolls were arranged in a circle around the cairn, their arms raised, their hands moving in precise, deliberate gestures.  And as they moved, the runes on their bodies pulsed with light, and the chanting reached a fever pitch.  The ground beneath us began to crack and split, and a wave of dark energy surged outwards from the cairn, engulfing the surrounding landscape.

I’ve fought trolls before.  I’ve faced down hordes of them in the depths of dungeons and the ruins of forgotten cities.  But I’ve never seen anything like this.  This wasn’t a mindless assault.  This was a ritual.  A deliberate, calculated act of power.

Fizzwick, surprisingly, was the first to break the stunned silence.  “By the gods… the geomancy!  They’re channeling the earth’s energy!  It’s… it’s incredible, and terrifying!”

Elara, her face pale with fear, began to chant a prayer to Pelor, her hand outstretched in supplication.  Faelan, ever vigilant, drew his bow, his eyes scanning the surrounding terrain for any sign of reinforcements.

I knew we had to act.  These trolls weren’t simply awakening something.  They were *summoning* something.  Something ancient and powerful.  And if they succeeded, the consequences could be catastrophic.

I charged forward, drawing my sword and shouting a challenge.  “Halt!  By the authority of the [insert appropriate deity/factions], I command you to cease this ritual!”

The trolls didn’t react.  They continued their chanting, their movements precise and unwavering.  They seemed… oblivious to my presence.  Or perhaps they simply didn’t care.

I realized then that brute force wouldn’t work.  These weren’t ordinary trolls.  They were imbued with something… more.  Something that made them resistant to physical attacks.

I tried to disrupt their ritual, to break their concentration.  I swung my sword, aiming for the trolls’ arms, hoping to sever their connection to the earth.  But my blows glanced harmlessly off their obsidian skin.  They didn’t even flinch.

It was Fizzwick who provided the key.  “The runes!  They’re the conduits!  If we can disrupt the runes, we can break the ritual!”

Fizzwick, despite his eccentricities, was a brilliant mind.  He quickly devised a plan.  He rummaged through his pack, pulling out a series of alchemical concoctions and a strange, humming device that looked like a cross between a tuning fork and a lightning rod.

While Elara and Faelan kept the trolls occupied, Fizzwick and I scrambled up the cairn, dodging the trolls’ movements and the falling debris.  The air grew thicker with the smell of sulfur, and the chanting intensified.  The runes on the cairn pulsed with an unholy light, and the ground beneath our feet trembled violently.

We reached the summit of the cairn, just as the trolls completed a particularly complex sequence of gestures.  The chanting reached a deafening crescendo, and a vortex of dark energy opened in the center of the cairn.

“Now!” Fizzwick shouted, activating his device.  He aimed it at the runes on the trolls’ bodies, and a beam of concentrated energy shot out, striking the runes with pinpoint accuracy.

The effect was immediate.  The runes on the trolls’ bodies flickered and died, their glowing light fading into nothingness.  The chanting faltered, and the vortex of dark energy began to shrink.

The trolls roared in frustration, their movements becoming erratic and disorganized.  They tried to defend their ritual, to rekindle the energy, but it was too late.  The connection to the earth had been severed.

The vortex of dark energy collapsed, and the ground beneath us stilled.  The chanting ceased, and the trolls collapsed to the ground, their bodies lifeless.

The silence that followed was deafening.  The air was thick with the smell of sulfur and the dust of the cairn.  We stood there, panting and exhausted, staring at the lifeless bodies of the trolls.

We didn’t stay long.  We left the cairn, and we left the Serpent Spine mountains.  We reported our findings to Lyra and the Thayan elders, and they vowed to seal the cairn once again, to prevent anything like this from ever happening again.

I never learned the full extent of what the trolls were trying to summon.  But I suspect it was something ancient and terrible, something that had been buried and sealed away for a reason.  Something that would have plunged Thay into darkness.

The experience left a mark on me.  It reminded me that there are forces in the world that are beyond our understanding, forces that are best left undisturbed.  And it reminded me that even the most seemingly insignificant events can have profound consequences.

I’ve seen many things in my travels, but the whispering cairns of Thay will forever remain etched in my memory.  A stark reminder of the darkness that lurks beneath the surface of the world, and the importance of vigilance in the face of the unknown.
