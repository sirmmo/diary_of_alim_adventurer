Silverymoon’s libraries might smell of parchment and pipe smoke these days, but I’ll never forget the salt-stink of Waterdeep’s Dock Ward—or the night I stumbled into a game of knives and lies that reshaped my understanding of fame, infamy, and the threads binding them. It was 1479 DR, the Year of the Ageless One, and I’d been hired for what seemed simple work: escort a "valuable client" through the city’s underbelly. The pay was good, the moon was a sliver, and I should’ve known better.  

### **The Marked Woman in the Copper Cup**  
The Copper Cup tavern was the kind of place where the ale hid its sourness behind enough cinnamon to make you weep. I’d just finished settling a dispute between two spice merchants over a missing manticore hide—*another* story—when a woman slid into the seat across from me. She wore scholar’s robes, but her eyes held the sharpness of a hawk who’d chased prey through storms. I’d learn later that she was Lorinda Hawksong, though at the time, she introduced herself only as "Lora."  

"We need to reach the House of Inspired Hands by dawn," she said, dropping a pouch of gold on the table. "Quietly."  

The gold was genuine. Her fear was quieter, but sharper. I took the job.  

### **Shadows in the Alleyways**  
Waterdeep after dark is a creature of its own. The grand façades of the Sea Ward fade to leaning tenements and boarded-up storefronts in the Dock Ward, where the air hums with the scent of fish guts and ambition. Lora moved like she knew these streets, her scholar’s cloak swapped for a hooded jerkin halfway through our journey.  

"Turn left here," she murmured near Siren’s Call Alley. "Avoid the lanterns."  

That’s when the whispers began. Three figures tailed us, their footsteps syncopated to mask their numbers. Guild muscle—Xanathar’s, if the mismatched armor and faint odor of wet rust (likely from ill-kept blades) were any clue. I nudged Lora toward a wider street, but she froze at the mouth of an alley.  

"*They know,*" she breathed.  

"Know what?" I asked, hand drifting to my shortsword.  

She didn’t answer. Instead, her fingers flickered in a sign I recognized from my days tangling with the Shadow Thieves of Amn—a thieves’ cant gesture: *"False mark. Trap springs eastward."*  

### **The Revelation and the Razor**  
Lora wasn’t just a scholar. She was the Blackstaff’s newest protégé, secretly investigating the Tears of Selûne—a smuggling ring funneling stolen Netherese artifacts to Xanathar’s Guild. The thieves had lured her into the open with forged letters, intending to slit her throat in the shadows. My presence? A happy accident they’d "account for."  

Fame, I’ve learned, is often a cloak for darker designs. Lorinda Hawksong would go on to become Waterdeep’s Blackstaff a decade later, her name sung in ballads. But that night? She was prey, and I was the fool who’d walked her into a snare.  

### **The Dance of Knives**  
They struck in Fell Alley, where the cobblestones glittered with frost and old bloodstains. Six of them, armed with serrated daggers and one hulking half-orc wielding a chain. Lora’s magic flared first—a burst of *frostbite* that encrusted the lead thug’s face in rime—but the half-orc charged me, chain whirling.  

Here’s the truth they don’t tell you about thieves’ guilds: their strength isn’t in numbers, but in patience. They’d rigged the alley. A tripwire snapped beneath my boot, and a net lined with fishhooks descended from the rooftops. I rolled, the hooks tearing grooves in my cloak, and came up with a dagger in each hand.  

Lora was a storm. She blasted one attacker with *magic missile*, pivoted, and parried a dagger with a wand that spat sparks like an angry forge. But the half-orc’s chain caught her shoulder, and she went down hard.  

### **The Choice That Lingers**  
I’d been paid to protect her. But as the half-orc loomed, spittle flying as he raised his chain for a killing blow, I did something reckless—or perhaps inevitable. I threw my last dagger *past* him. It struck a hanging lantern, igniting a cascade of oil-soaked rags Xanathar’s crew had left as a distraction. Fire roared across the alley’s mouth, cutting off reinforcements.  

The half-orc turned, snarling, and I drove my shortsword through a gap in his rusted breastplate. He fell like a mountain. The remaining thieves scattered, their courage as thin as cheap ale.  

### **Aftermath and Whispered Truths**  
Lora’s shoulder healed, thanks to a potion from my pack. She pressed a ring into my palm as dawn broke over Mount Waterdeep—a silver band etched with tiny stars. "For discretion," she said. "And gratitude."  

I’ve wondered often what would’ve happened had I refused that job. Lorinda’s rise to power shaped Waterdeep’s fate through the Guild Wars. Would she have survived that alley without me? Maybe. Would I have learned that fame is often born in the moments no ballads sing of—the gritted teeth, the split-second gambles, the blood on your gloves? Absolutely.  

### **The Lesson in the Shadows**  
I share this not to boast (gods know luck saved me as much as skill that night), but because Silverymoon’s guilds weave schemes that would feel familiar to that young sellsword in Waterdeep. The politics here? Kinder, perhaps, but power always casts shadows. I attend those council meetings now not because I love intrigue, but because I’ve seen what fester in corners left unwatched.  

Lorinda—*Blackstaff* Hawksong—still sends word on occasion. Her last letter bore a single line in thieves’ cant: *"The lanterns burn brighter when old friends trim the wicks."*  

Perhaps I’ll tell her someday how close we both came to becoming just another pair of nameless corpses in Fell Alley. Or perhaps not. Some stories thrive in the light. Others? They keep the city’s heart beating in the dark.  

—Alim Kors, signing off with a toast to fools, heroes, and the messy line between them.
