*Posted in the Silver Scrolls Gazette, 15th of Eleint, 1492 DR*  

There are moments that sear themselves into memory, not for their violence or heroism, but for their sheer, shuddering awe. The night I speak of was one such moment—a collision of natural splendor and mortal folly that reminded even a jaded soul like mine why Silverymoon is called the Gem of the North. To this day, I swear the city’s mythals sang that evening, and the heavens themselves convened to scold a pack of fools who forgot that nature’s magic bows to no guild’s agenda.  

Let me set the scene.  

### **I. The Setting: Silverymoon in the Rain of Stars**  
It was the final night of Highharvestide, seven winters past. The air crackled with the chill of autumn’s embrace, but the city blazed with warmth. Bonfires dotted the parks, minstrels played ballads of the Harpers’ glory, and the Unicorn Run glittered under lantern-light. I’d retired from adventuring by then—*mostly*—though my old habits kept me drifting through twilight crowds, nursing honeymead at the Blue Elm Tavern or swapping tales with the Watch Captain’s graybeards. Life was quiet but far from dull.  

Then came Auril’s Tear.  

Every thirty years, as the arcane scholars insist, a meteor shower streaks over the High Forest so vividly it paints the night in violet and silver. Some whisper it’s spilled magic from the long-lost *City of Summer’s Twilight*; others claim Mystra herself weeps for her fallen Chosen. Practical folk? They call it pyromancers’ nonsense and hand their children glow-stones to mimic the spectacle. But that night, the heavens roared to life. Stars didn’t just fall—they *danced*, trailing ribbons of light that set the mythal-veined towers humming like struck crystal.  

A crowd gathered on the Moonbridge, gasping as the sky rippled. Among them, unnoticed by all but a retired rogue with time to kill, slipped three shadows cloaked in dusk-gray.  

### **II. The Guild’s Gamble**  
Ah, the Silvertongue Guild. Thieves with pretensions. They fancied themselves artists, targeting nobles’ manors without shedding blood or breaking wards. But arrogance breeds blind spots, and they’d planned a heist that ignored the oldest rule: Never steal when the Weave is restless.  

Their mark? The estate of Lady Alyndra—a collector of Netherese relics and, crucially, a woman whose vaults lay beneath a garden woven with dormant weather magic. I’d heard whispers of the guild’s plot weeks prior—*a “surgical strike” during the meteor shower, when the Watch would be distracted*. Fools. You don’t “distract” Silverymoon’s mythals. You plead with them politely.  

I trailed the thieves out of habit, not intent. Their leader, a smooth-voiced charmer called Naelin, had enchanted lockpicks humming in his palms. His accomplices: a wiry halfling scaling walls like a spider, and a sorceress whose shadow-walks left faint trails of frost—a telltale sign of Shadar-Kai blood. Clever, but not clever enough.  

### **III. The Night Unravels**  
Lady Alyndra’s gardens were a tapestry of moon-kissed hedges and marble fountains. The guild slipped through the perimeter, melting into darkness. But as Naelin’s tools grazed the vault door, the first meteor pierced the clouds overhead—a blazing spear of amethyst light.  

And the garden *awoke*.  

Dormant magic, stirred by the celestial cascade, erupted. Frost spiraled up the thieves’ boots. Vines lashed like whips. And then—the skies *opened*.  

A second meteor, broader than a dragon’s wingspan, tore through the clouds. Instead of fading, it *shattered* above the estate, showering the grounds in emerald sparks. The sorceress shrieked as her shadow-magic inverted, casting her silhouette in blinding light. Panicked, she hissed an incantation to summon a fog veil—a child’s trick against the divine.  

The collision was inevitable.  

Celestial fire met shadow-weave. The garden’s wards, the meteors’ raw magic, and the thief’s reckless spell fused into a thunderclap that split the night. A helix of violet and green energy erupted skyward, swallowing the meteor’s remnants. For three heartbeats, Silverymoon glowed like a struck match. The mythals flared gold in response, ringing like cathedral bells.  

### **IV. Aftermath: Ashes, Amusement, and Mercy**  
When the light faded, Lady Alyndra’s garden was a scorched ruin—sculptures melted, vault door warped beyond recognition, and the thieves kneeling in a puddle of melted frost. Their loot? Vaporized. The guild’s pride? As fractured as the sky.  

I’ll confess, I laughed. Not at their failure, but at the irony. Naelin gaped at the heavens like a scolded pup. The sorceress clutched her singed cloak, cursing Auril, Mystra, and a dozen other gods I won’t name in polite print.  

The Watch arrived swiftly, led by a Captain whose smirk told me she’d anticipated this idiocy. The guild was hauled off—not to dungeons, but to reparations hearings. Lady Alyndra, ever pragmatic, charged them with rebuilding her garden. Last I heard, Naelin grows prize-winning moonflowers under the Watch’s watchful eye.  

As for the rest of us? We stood in the suddenly-hushed streets, necks craned at the sky. The meteors still fell, gentler now, as if chastened. The mythals sighed back into slumber. And Silverymoon, ever resilient, breathed deeper for having witnessed magic’s caprice.  

### **V. The Lesson Writ in Stars**  
Years later, young adventurers sometimes corner me at the Blue Elm, asking, *“Alim! Did you truly see the sky explode that night?”*  

I correct them gently: *“Not explode. Rebuke.”*  

Nature’s magic tolerates no arrogance. Silverymoon’s mythals endure because they respect balance—something thieves (and adventurers) learn only after a few scars. That night, the heavens didn’t punish greed; they *reminded* us of scale. We are small beneath the stars, yes, but that’s no insult—it’s an invitation to witness wonders beyond our schemes.  

So, young fools plotting your next glorious misadventure, heed an old man’s advice: Look up. Sometimes the sky has better plans than you do.
