**By Alim Kors, Retired Blade of the Silver Marches**

Every citizen of Silverymoon carries within them a memory of light—the diamond-pure glow of the great Moonbridge, the silver dusting of true-silver veins in marble towers, or perhaps the lambent warmth of hearthstones harvested from Deep Imaskar’s ruins. We are a city cradled by magic, but complacent in its embrace. We forget, sometimes, that the Weave is less a tapestry than a living sea beneath our feet, capable of tides and riptides beyond mortal ken. Ten winters past, I witnessed such a tide—a confluence of stolen ambition, leyline turbulence, and a thieves’ guild’s desperate gamble—that spilled starlight onto the cobbles of the Gilded Ward and very nearly unmade us all.

### I. Portents in the Prosaic

It began, as such things often do, in mundanity. I’d retired from active adventuring by then, trading my pack and battered breastplate for a council seat in the Guild of Artificers and Prospectors. Politics, in Silverymoon, is a gentle sport—more philosophical debates over arcane zoning ordinances than the knife-work of southern courts. On the evening of Eleasis 17th, I was leaving the Hall of Speakers after a particularly soporific debate on mithral extraction quotas in the Rauvin foothills. The air held that peculiar clarity unique to late summer nights in the North—sharp with pine resin yet softened by the murmurs of the Unicorn Run threading below the city walls.

As I crossed Victory Plaza, my boots scuffing the bas-reliefs of long-dead heroes, I noted an unusual shimmer in the Starry Sphere fountain—a public work of enchantment where captured starlight danced perpetually between sculpted zodiac figures. The water flickered not with its usual silver-blue, but with threads of viridian and amethyst. A shift in the Weave? Minor planar leakage? I’d seen stranger. Chalked it up to some University thaumaturgy experiment bleeding over from the Spires of the Arcanists and made to move on.

Then the wind changed.

It came not from the mountains, but upward—as if the cobblestones themselves exhaled. A low hum vibrated in the molars, felt more than heard. Pigeons erupted from the eaves of the Argent Archive, wings silent. I turned to see them silhouetted against a moon suddenly haloed by a kaleidoscopic corona—a phenomenon more suited to the Elemental Plane of Radiance than sober Faerûn. 

### II. When the Veil Thinned

The Starry Sphere fountain wasn’t just shimmering anymore—it was *singing*. Jets of liquid starlight arced fifty feet into the air, crystallizing mid-fall into jagged, chiming shards that dissolved before striking the ground. The zodiac figures—Gemini’s twins, stoic Taurus—began to orbit the central spire, shedding stone petals to reveal glowing crystal cores within. A crowd gathered, not fearful but enraptured. This was Silverymoon, after all; uncanny beauty was our birthright.

But I’d spent thirty years smelling trouble beneath perfume. My fingers twitched for a sword absent at my hip. This wasn’t artistry—it was uncontrolled bleed. The Weave wasn’t resonating. It was hemorrhaging.

Then came the whispers. Not from the crowd, but from the air itself:

*"Children of Mystra… behold the ghost in the loom…"*

An elderly elven mage beside me, Master Thaladir of the Harpers, went pale. **"Weaveghost,"** he breathed, a word I’d heard only in apocryphal texts. **"A consciousness born from tangled ley lines and mortal meddling. A sentient flaw in the tapestry."** 

The fountain’s spire split open like a geode. From its heart unfurled a thing of iridescent filaments—strands of pure magic, coalescing into the silhouette of a woman twelve feet tall, her features as shifting as starlight on water. She—or *it*—drew breath, and the city sighed with her. Trees in distant gardens bent toward the plaza, roots groaning beneath the streets.

### III. Shadows in the Starlight

That’s when the thieves struck.

The Ghostlight Runners—an upstart guild preying on enchanted artifacts—had their lair beneath the Gilded Ward. It was an open secret, tolerated because they kept violence minimal and occasionally returned trinkets in exchange for clemency. But that night, emboldened by the chaos, they launched not for loot, but for *conquest*.

They swarmed from alleys and rooftop platforms, forty strong in magically muffled leathers, faces obscured behind prismatic smoke-screen charms. Their leader, a gaunt tiefling called Mistra Postern, carried a staff glowing with sickly cerulean energy—a stolen *Voidrender* artifact recently pillaged from an Illefarn crypt. We’d known the Runners had become dangerously ambitious, but none foresaw this mad gambit: harnessing the Weaveghost’s birth-throes to amplify the staff’s power, aiming to shatter Silverymoon’s defensive wards in a single cataclysmic pulse.

Alchemist fires burst against the Argent Archive’s doors. Voidrender bolts crackled against animated guard-statues. Postern’s crew channeled their stolen weapons—jagged, hungry things—toward the luminous vortex above the fountain. The Weaveghost shuddered, filaments darkening at the contact. Where struck, it began to *scream*—a sound like glass scraping bone, felt in the marrow of every being within a half-mile. The githzerai ambassador collapsed, clutching his skull. A rain of half-formed stars spattered the crowd, burning like acid where they struck flesh.

### IV. Improvised Damnation

I wasn’t armed. Wasn’t armoured. My only assets: sixty-three years of bad decisions, the lingering dampening wards on my prosthetic left arm (a relic from a botched disarmament during the Troll Wars), and Thaladir, who'd already begun an intricate counterspell, fingers carving sigils into the humming air.

But Postern was charging the Voidrender staff—a weapon meant to sunder planar barriers—directly into the Weaveghost’s core. If they fused the energies, the backlash could unravel every enchantment from the Moonbridge to the smithies of the Mithral Hall.

So I did what fools and old soldiers do: I acted.

The fountain plaza’s central grate, camouflaged by illusionary turf, covered a maintenance shaft to the Storm Drain Labyrinth—Silverymoon’s ancient runoff system. I’d traversed it thrice before during Council inspections. With a hissed apology to the city engineers, I kicked the loosened grate aside and dropped into the dark, landing knee-deep in chill water. 

The shaft ran fifty yards north, beneath Lyrabar Street, before intersecting the Runner’s lair. I’d always suspected their bolt-hole connected to the drains—traces of their smuggled alchemical supplies lingered near vents. Now, rushing blind through frigid tunnels, I heard shouts ahead. The main force was topside, but every den needs a rear guard. 

Three young rogues flanked a junction, knives drawn. The lead—a moon elf barely old enough to shave—snarled, **"Councilor Alim? Stay back, old man!"**

They thought me feeble. Let them. 

I flung sewer water into their eyes, slammed the dampening rod in my wrist prosthetic into the first boy’s solar plexus (activating the charged paralysis rune—never leave home without it), and grappled the second into a chokehold while tripping the third with a sweep of my dripping boot. No artistry, just dirt. Combat’s addictive polish fades with retirement, but the gristle remains. They crumpled, winded but unharmed. Youth deserved that mercy.

Beyond them lay Postern’s sanctum—cluttered with half-dismantled constructs and racks of glow vial poisons. But on a pulsing alchemical workstation sat their true prize: a stolen *Core Stabilizer* from the Arcane Collegium, jury-rigged to feed the Voidrender staff. 

With Thaladir holding the breach above, Postern needed this crude regulator to prevent the staff from immolating them mid-cast. 

A diagnostic lens glowed red: OVERLOAD IMMINENT—96%.

I wasn’t a wizard. Couldn’t dispel. But my artificer’s license hadn’t lapsed. Wrenching tools from the wall, I tore into the stabilizer—not to disarm it, but to *accelerate* the cascade. It sparked wild, metal hot enough to sear fingerprints. The readout screamed: 99%...100%...

With a crack of displaced air, the Stabilizer detonated—a contained implosion that sucked loose papers, tools, and my breath into a microsingularity before spitting them out scorched. 

Topside, Postern’s scream joined the Weaveghost’s.

### V. Cascade and Calm

Emerging gasping into the plaza, I found chaos reoriented. Postern was staggering, Voidrender staff shattered in her blistered hands. The Weaveghost, freed from the parasitic drain, was expanding, filaments reaching for the spires of the Arcanists’ Quarter. 

But Master Thaladir—supported by arrived Battle Wizards and clergy of Mystra—had woven a containment lattice of spell-song and holy verses. High Priestess Elaithra’s voice rose clear above the din: **"Mystra’s grace accepts all threads, even those born tangled. Rest now, child."**

The Weaveghost hesitated. Her form softened, rage melting into curiosity. Eyes like liquid galaxies met mine—and winked.

Then she unraveled. 

Twenty thousand strands of light spiraled upward, weaving through Silverymoon’s towers in a helix of shimmering gold and icy blue. They settled not as destruction, but as benediction: 

- Every street lamp burned twice as bright for a year and a day.
- Gardens erupted in out-of-season blossoms despite autumn frost.
- The cracked keystone in the Bridge of Sighs—a perennial repair headache—knitted itself whole.
- Every child born that night gained heterochromatic eyes.
- Postern’s guild tattoos faded entirely, leaving skin blank as a babe’s.

As for the Ghostlight Runners? Scattered. Broken. Postern herself fled north into the High Forest—last I heard, working as a hermitess distilling mushroom inks. Turned out well for her. Better than most thieves who court the Weave’s ire.

### VI. Reflections Under a Restored Sky

Silverymoon rebuilt swiftly. The Starry Sphere was reconsecrated with a new twelve-faced statue: the Weaveghost as a benevolent, many-handed weaver. Children leave offerings of prismatic quartz there during the Moonfest.

But deeper lessons linger in council chambers and alleyways alike:

1. **Magic’s Sentience Demands Respect**: We treat enchantment as a tool, but the Weave is alive—capricious, generous, wounded by abuse. Our regulatory protocols tightened after the incident; planar manipulators undergo psyche screenings akin to priests now.

2. **Underbellies Need Monitoring**: My leniency toward small guilds ended that night. I spearheaded the Integrated Shadow Accords—nonlethal surveillance and negotiated terms for minor syndicates. Let them ply petty trades, but cross a line? No second chances.

3. **Culture is Consequence**: We rebuilt the Argent Archive’s doors with Postern’s splintered Voidrender staff melted into the bronze inlays—a reminder that knowledge’s guardianship requires eternal vigilance.

4. **Our Scars Speak**: My prosthetic still buzzes near strong magic—a useful warning system. The dampened arm saved lives. Wouldn’t trade the twinges for anything.

Sometimes, when lecturing apprentice artificers, I catch the gilded crater where the fountain’s spire once stood. They want tales of dragons felled and treasure vaults cracked. I give them this instead—a ghost that was never theirs to command, a city that bent but didn't break, and an old fool who remembered that sewers have uses beyond shit. 

In Silverymoon, even disaster wears moonlight. Especially then.
