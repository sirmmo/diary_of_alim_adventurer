The air smells different in Thay. Even now, decades later, the mere memory summons the scent—coppery dust, bitter herbs burned in perpetual censers, and beneath it all, the unsettling sweetness of decay carried on arid winds. It is a land where the earth itself seems to mourn, where necromancy bleeds into the soil and corrupts the roots of things. Few travelers willingly venture into that red-rocked desolation ruled by the Red Wizards. Fewer still return with tales worth hearing. But I did not go to Thay seeking wonder. I went to escort a group of desperate refugees out of that blighted place, and instead, I bore witness to a defiance of natural law that humbled even the most jaded soul—a miracle born of desperation, faith, and the fury of a paladin who refused to let hope die.

That miracle, I believe, began with Sister Thalessa Dawnshield. Introduced to me as merely the refugees’ spiritual guardian by their trembling elder on the shores of the Lake of Salt, I initially underestimated her. She was quiet where her charges were frantic, calm where they radiated terror. Her armor, though bearing the sunrise sigil of Lathander, was scratched and dulled by hard travel. Only her eyes hinted at the fire within—a dawn-facing intensity that flickered whenever she looked east, toward the obsidian spires of Eltabbar where the lich-lords plotted. The refugees—eighteen gaunt souls, half of them children—whispered that she’d smuggled them out from a work camp near the Sunrise Pools, where Thayan magic bleeds the land’s vitality to fuel their foul constructs. They called her *D’orash*, “Day’s Edge,” in their hushed dialect. They did not say it with reverence, but with something closer to awe… and fear.

Our path out was treacherous. The Thaymount’s jagged passes offered scant cover, and the Red Wizard patrols hunted escapees with packs of magically-twisted hounds whose howls echoed like damned souls. Thalessa walked at the rear always, hand resting on her sword hilt but rarely drawing it. She did not sleep. Her vigilance unnerved me. When I asked how she’d kept her charges alive so long, she simply said: “We walk where light falls.” Mystifying, until the third night.

It happened near the Sulfur Wastes, a blasted expanse where acidic springs boiled beneath cracked earth, and the air stank of rotten eggs and worse. We’d bedded down in a shallow cave, shielded from the worst fumes but exposed should the patrols crest the eastern ridge. I had the first watch. The moon was veiled by smoke, casting the wastes in corpse-pale gloom. Thalessa knelt at the cave mouth, eyes closed, palms pressed to the hot, lifeless stone. Praying. Then the ground began to tremble.

I thought it an earthquake at first—common enough in those unstable peaks. But this was different. Rhythmic. Purposeful. *Footsteps.* From the reeking mists emerged figures. Ten. Twenty. More. Undead laborers, their withered bodies still clad in the tattered rags of Thayan slaves, lurching with unnatural speed. Behind them rode three figures in blood-red robes atop skeletal steeds—lesser necromancers, scouts perhaps, but no less deadly for their rank. Their leader raised a hand crackling with black energy, his voice a guttural command in High Thayan. The dead surged forward.

We were trapped. The cave was a dead end. The refugees woke screaming. Children huddled against the rock as their parents grasped useless farming tools. My own blade felt pitifully small. But Thalessa… Thalessa became a tempest.

She met the first wave at the cave mouth, her sword blazing like captive sunlight. Where it struck the walking corpses, they didn’t just fall—they *dissolved*, ashes scattering on the sulfurous wind. Her voice rose above the chaos, not in a battle cry, but in a hymn—a paean to Lathander’s inexorable dawn. For a moment, the sheer ferocity of her faith held them back. But the necromancers merely laughed. One gestured, and the withered hands of the dead began clawing at the cave’s ceiling. Rocks rained down. A child screamed as a boulder crushed her mother’s legs. Another necromancer unleashed a wave of chilling black mist that sapped the strength from our limbs. Thalessa staggered. Her light flickered.

That’s when she did it. That mad, glorious, terrifying thing.

Sheathing her sword, the paladin dropped to her knees and drove her bare hands into the blackened, poisoned soil of Thay. Blood dripped from a gash on her temple as she began to pray—not whispered entreaties, but a roar that shook the stones beneath us.

“Hear me, Lathander! Your servant stands at the edge of night! But I *refuse* to let their shadows claim these souls!” Her voice rose, raw and furious. “You taught us that light *must* rise! So rise! Rise through this broken ground! Rise through this tortured earth! Let the land itself REMEMBER what it was before their corruption!”

For a heartbeat, nothing. The necromancers sneered. Their undead closed in. Then—

The ground beneath Thalessa’s hands began to *glow*. Not her holy light, but a deep, subterranean luminescence—amber, gold, violet—swirling up through the soil like molten gemstones. The necromancers’ laughter died. The glow spread, racing outward in jagged veins of radiance that split the rocky ground. Then the earth exploded.

Not from violence, but from vitality. From where Thalessa knelt, the land *erupted*.

First came the roots—massive, knotted things thicker than a giant’s arm, bursting from the ground and curling around the undead. Where they touched, decades of necromantic rot reversed. Desiccated flesh bloomed with moss, fungus, then wildflowers that sprouted and withered in seconds, returning the corpses to peaceful decay. The roots coiled upward, forming a living barrier between us and the Red Wizards.

Then the water followed. Clean, cool water—impossible in those parched wastes—geysered from a dozen cracks, scouring away the sulfur stench, forming shimmering pools amidst the roots. Where it touched the blackened stone, lichen spread in emerald waves. Where it touched us, exhaustion lifted. The girl’s crushed mother gasped as strength returned to her legs.

But Thalessa wasn’t done. Rocking back on her heels, she lifted her bloodied hands skyward, still chanting. That’s when the trees arrived. No—not arrived. *Awoke.*

From every glowing fissure, ancient, colossal trunks *surged* upward, breaking through rock as easily as saplings through fertile soil. Their bark gleamed like burnished copper, their leaves shimmering silver. They grew to full height in seconds, forming a grove where moments before had been lifeless waste. And from their branches fell not seeds, but *light*—solid motes of gold that hung in the air, drifting like fireflies. Where they touched the Thayan mages, their red robes smoldered. Their undead steeds collapsed into harmless bone. The lead necromancer shrieked as a mote landed on his outstretched hand, burning not his flesh, but the necromantic sigils tattooed there. The marks *bled*, then faded. He fled, his fellows scrambling after him, the very earth rejecting their presence.

Silence fell, thick and sacred. The new-groved trees rustled in a wind that smelled of rain-washed hills, not sulfur. The pools glimmered faintly, their waters impossibly clear. Thalessa collapsed. I caught her before she hit the luminous grass now sprouting from once-dead ground. Her hands were raw, her face pale, but she lived. When the refugees approached, weeping, to touch the hem of her cloak, she hushed them. “Not me,” she rasped. “The land… remembers. It only needed… a spark.”

We sheltered in that impossible grove until the refugees regained strength. By dawn’s first true light, the miracle had… faded. Not vanished. The pools shrank to mere springs. The great trees stood but seemed somehow dormant, their metallic bark dulled. Yet life persisted. Moss softened the stones. Wildflowers dotted the grass. And etched into the stone where Thalessa had knelt remained a perfect imprint of her hands, faintly glowing.

The Red Wizards never returned. Perhaps they feared what they could not control. Perhaps they dared not face the truth Thalessa had awoken—that beneath their tyranny, Thay’s heart still beat, its memory of life buried but unbroken.

Years later, traveling bards sing of the Dawnshield Grove, now a secret sanctuary for Thay’s oppressed. Those who’ve seen it say the handprints still glow faintly at sunrise. I cannot confirm this. I never went back. Some wonders are too vast to revisit. But sometimes, when Silverymoon’s council chambers grow stuffy with politics, I step into the moonlight and close my eyes. The scent of copper leaves and clean water washes over me once more, and I remember the simple, shattering truth Thalessa taught me that night in a land of death:

No corruption is absolute. No darkness is endless. Beneath the stain of evil, life remembers. Wait for the spark. Be ready to witness. And occasionally, if you’re terribly lucky or terribly blessed, you might just bear that spark yourself.
